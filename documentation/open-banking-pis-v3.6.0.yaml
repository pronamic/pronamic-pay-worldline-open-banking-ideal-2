    # Introduction    
    There are several flows (sequence of API calls) to complete a payment. Which
    API's are required depend on the choosen `PaymentProduct`, ASPSP (debtor bank) and the chosen strong customer
    authentication approach. The response of an API call will indicate in the 'Links' section which next
    API call is required to complete the payment. Both PSD2 and IDEAL payments are supported.

    ## Sandbox
    Several AspspId's are available to test specific PSD2 payment initiation scenario's, see sandbox documentation.

    The following authorization token can be used to test in the sandbox (unlike a real token this one doesn't expire):

        Use this operation to initiate a payment on behalf of the Payment
        Service User. Strong customer authentication might be required by the ASPSP,
        the response will indicate which step is required to complete the payment.
